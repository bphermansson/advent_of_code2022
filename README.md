Advent Of Code 2002, day 1
 * Input is a given list with Elfs that carries food with various calories. 
 * Each Elf has different amount of food items, and each food item has a different amount of calories. 
 * The task is to find how many calories the Elf who carries the most calories is carrying. 
 * Each Elf in the list is separated by an empty row. 
 * So we read the list line by line and adds the calories carried by each Elf. Then we save the 
 * highest calorie count and present it to the user.
